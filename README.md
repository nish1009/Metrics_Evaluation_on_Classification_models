# Metrics Evaluation on Classification_models

## Introduction
In this notebook, I have implemented different evaluation metrics using numpy
* Precision
* Recall
* f1 score
* f beta
* receiver operator classification

## Dataset
Have a look at the dataset [link](https://github.com/rajatsharma369007/Metrics_Evaluation_on_Classification_models/blob/master/SMSSpamCollection)  
The first column is the label describing ham as good mail and spam as the spam mail and last column shows the email content.
